.. cli_usage::
Command line usage
*******************

Houston cli is an easy and convienient way to manage your spacewalk / satellite
Server. It allows you to do complex time coonsuming tasks quickly and easily
such as cloning whole channel groups, adding and removing packages from your
channels having any subscribed systems downgrade their installed versions to
match.

This is still a work in progress but new features will be added as they are
coded.

Usage:::

   houston [general options] COMMAND <command options>

General options are:::

    -s | --serverurl
        This is the url of the spacewalk / satellite server to connect to.
        Although this argument is optional if it is omitted it must be found in
        the configuration file. See `config` for more details.

    -u | --username
        This is the username to authenticate with. Again if ommited it must be
        present in the configuration file. See `config` for more details.

    --version
        version of houston being invoked.


In addition a password is required to successfully authenticate against the
spacewalk server. If this is not found in the `config` file then houston will
prompt the user for a password if it is able. Otherwise houston will abort.

.. cli_commands::
Commands:
=========

.. cli_channel_commmands::
channel
-------

The Channel commands all relate to tasks involving channels. These will be
expanded upon.

Channel commands available:::
    clone
    delete
    migrate

.. cli_channel_clone::
clone
^^^^^

The clone subcommand will take a base channel and clone it using a specific
nameing scheme.

.. option:: -p --project
    The name of the project the new clone will be used for

.. option:: -t --tag
    The name of the tag for the project the clone wil be used for.


This allows simple cloning of channels without having to specify whole channel
names which can quickly get unweildy.

eg:

Assuming we're working on project GOON, and a new feature has been added,
Minion,  which needs testing. This testeing may require different versinos of
php, apache etc to other projects in place and so will need a seperate channel
on spacewalk. by calling:::

    houston channel clone -p GOON -t minion --src <orig channel>

a new channel will be created named *dev-GOON-<mon>-minion-<orig>* where <mon>
is the short month eg, jan, feb etc and orig is the name of the channel used as
the source of the clone.

Clone will allway prepend the channel name with dev as any other environments
eg qa staging should be generated using :ref:`rollout <cli_channnel_rollout>`
as this will keep any changes from the dev channel consistent.
